# Data Jobs Survey Analysis By (Power BI)

## Overview
- This project involves analyzing survey data from data field workers, including Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Architects. 
- The data was cleaned and visualized using Power BI to gain insights into various aspects such as average salary per job title, favorite programming language, worker happiness with their salary, work/life balance, and learning curve.

## Project Details
### Data Source
The data used for this project comes from a real survey conducted among data field workers. The survey results are stored in an Excel file.

### Data Cleaning
Before visualizing the data, several cleaning steps were performed:
- Deleting unimportant columns
- Handling missing values
- Splitting some columns to make some aggregation functions 

### Visualizations
The following visualizations were created using Power BI:
